                    <h3>Dog Helps Rescue Owner Who Fell 70 Feet in California Forest</h3>
                    <p>Saul, a black Border collie, helped lead search and rescue crews to his owner, who the authorities said had broken his hip
                        and multiple ribs after falling from a ridge. A 53-year-old man and his black Border collie, Saul, were on a hike last week 
                        near California’s Tahoe National Forest, surrounded by trees and steep canyons, when something went wrong. The man fell 70 feet 
                        from a ridge, breaking his hip and multiple ribs, the authorities said. He had no phone. Just a dog by his side. <!--The man, whose name 
                        the authorities did not release, crawled up a rocky bluff to his camp where he had been staying, and was able to call 911 about noon on
                        July 13 and ask for help, said Sgt. Dennis Haack of the Nevada County Sheriff’s Office. About seven hours later, volunteers with the Nevada 
                        County Sheriff’s Search and Rescue group came across Saul in the forest. The dog jumped up and down, spun around in circles and ran 20 feet 
                        ahead of them, Sergeant Haack said. Then, Saul looked back at the volunteers, he said, as if to say: Follow me. “Hey, I think this dog is 
                        trying to lead us somewhere,” Sergeant Haack recalled a volunteer saying by radio. “So we’re going to follow him.” Sergeant Haack and others 
                        at a nearby command post were puzzled. “We didn’t put a whole lot of faith in it,” he said. “But I do put a lot of faith in our searchers 
                        because they’re extremely good at what they do.” They followed Saul for about 200 yards, and there, lying in a bed of dirt and covered by 
                        a camouflage tarp, was the injured man, in pain but grateful for his loyal pet and the volunteers.--->
